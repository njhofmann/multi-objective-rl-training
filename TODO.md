- why mountaincart and acrobot failing?
- entropy?
- epsilon & damping tuning
- is mdmm loss equal to jax
- show std on rolling avg
    - have X samples at each timepoint 
    - group samples at k-1 timepoints with points in k-th timepoint
        - [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3
        - [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]
- track lambda
- gae lambda?
